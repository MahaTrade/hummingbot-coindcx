# CoinDCX Connector for Hummingbot
This is an implementation of the CoinDCX connector (https://coindcx.com). It is prepared to be used with [Hummingbot client](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot).

Hummingbot is an open-source project that integrates cryptocurrency trading on both **centralized exchanges** and **decentralized protocols**. It allows users to run a client that executes customized, automated trading strategies for cryptocurrencies.

We created hummingbot to promote **decentralized market-making**: enabling members of the community to contribute to the liquidity and trading efficiency in cryptocurrency markets.
